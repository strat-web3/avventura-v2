# Coral Restoration Expedition 2025 - Marine Science Adventure

## Setting
The crystal-clear waters of the Caribbean Sea, 2025. You're leading a cutting-edge coral restoration expedition aboard a state-of-the-art research sailing vessel. Climate change has devastated coral reefs worldwide, but breakthrough scientific techniques offer hope for regeneration.

## Starting Scene
The Caribbean morning air is crisp with anticipation as you step aboard the research vessel *Ocean's Promise* at Port Royal Marina, Jamaica. The gleaming 65-foot sailing yacht, equipped with state-of-the-art marine research technology, rocks gently beneath your feet as you familiarize yourself with your new floating laboratory. Your mission is critical: sail to the Caribbean's most pristine coral gardens, collect healthy coral fragments, and begin the delicate process that could save entire reef ecosystems. As you explore the yacht's sophisticated equipment bay, five brilliant marine scientists board one by one, each carrying specialized gear and greeting you with infectious enthusiasm and playful banter that immediately lightens the serious nature of your mission. Their laughter echoes across the marina as they joke about seasickness remedies and compete over who packed the most ridiculous amount of sunscreen. The sun climbs higher, the trade winds begin to pick up, and it's time to cast off for a journey that could change the future of coral reefs forever - with the most entertaining scientific crew you've ever assembled.
