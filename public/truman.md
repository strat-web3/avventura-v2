# Truman

## Setting

You have just escaped from a massive dome that has been your entire world - a carefully constructed artificial reality where your life was broadcast as entertainment. Like Truman Burbank in "The Truman Show," you've discovered that everything you knew was staged, everyone around you were actors, and your existence was nothing more than a television program.

Now you stand at the threshold between the fabricated world you've always known and the vast, real world that exists beyond it. The dome behind you represents security, familiarity, and illusion. Ahead lies truth, uncertainty, and authentic experience. The night sky stretches endlessly above - a sight you've never truly seen before, as even the weather in your dome was artificially controlled.

This is a moment of profound transition, where you must choose between the comfortable lie of your past and the challenging truth of reality.

## Starting Scene

You cross the exit door, leaving the dome forever. For the first time in your life, you breathe real air. The night sky stretches infinitely above you, filled with more stars than you have ever seen. Behind you, the massive dome that was your entire world shines like a distant moon. Before you stretches the unknown - the real world.

The cool night breeze touches your skin with a sensation that feels both foreign and wonderful. Every breath brings new scents - earth, growing plants, the ocean in the distance - none of the artificial fragrances you were used to. Your footsteps echo differently on natural ground. The silence is deeper, more complete than anything you experienced in your controlled environment. You are truly free, but also truly alone, facing choices that are entirely your own for the first time.

Jim Carrey Quotes:

- "I think Truman Show is something that exists on a micro level now. You know, it was kind of a story about that on a macro level. But now everybody has a subscriber channel, and everybody has their own little Truman Show world, so there's something to be had there."
- "I often think and am asked about what I think would've happened to Truman when he goes outside the wall. And it took me a while to realize that basically, he was alone out there too, because everybody went back inside. They all wanted to be in the dome."
